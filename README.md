**Dataset**
Flipkart E-commerce Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/code/atharvjairath/flipkart/data

**Task**
1. Take a data set of your choice (classification data set)- prefer a bit large size dataset.
2. Divide data set into 60%(Train dataset) and 40% (Test dataset) Create five samples randomly from 60% dataset (sample size 70%)
3. Train KNN on each sample
4. Note down the efficiency (test dataset (40% data set)) of all five models
5. Develop an ensemble mode as: combine all 5 models and final results will be calculated as voting
6. Test ensemble model on 40% data-set and note down the efficiency
7. Observations and learning outcomes
