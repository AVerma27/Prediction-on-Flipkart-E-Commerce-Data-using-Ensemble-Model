# Prediction of the "Primary Category" of the product Flipkart E-Commerce Data using Ensemble Model


In this project Flipkart E-Commerce dataset was initially split into 60-40 train and test dataset followed by divding the dataset randomly into 5 parts.The initial 60% dataset is trained on K-Fold cross validator, Multinomial Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The sample size of the divided dataset is taken as 70%. Each sampled dataset is then trained on K-Nearest Neighbor. Using the 5 trained sample, Ensemble model is developed with soft as well as hard voting.
