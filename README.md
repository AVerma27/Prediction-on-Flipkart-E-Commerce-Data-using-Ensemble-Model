Take a data set of your choice (classification data set)- prefer a bit large size dataset.
Divide data set into 60%(Train dataset) and 40% (Test dataset) Create five samples randomly from 60% dataset (sample size 70%)
Train KNN on each sample
Note down the efficiency (test dataset (40% data set)) of all five models
Develop an ensemble mode as: combine all 5 models and final results will be calculated as voting
Test ensemble model on 40% data-set and note down the efficiency
List your observations and learning outcomes
